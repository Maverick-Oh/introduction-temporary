# Maverick S. H. Oh

I am a PhD student at University of California, Merced.

This homepage is in preparatoin; I am learning how to make it. There will be an update soon, I hope.

I am working on modeling and analysis of gravitationally lensed quasar systems to understand and constrain dark matter properties.

I am using the data from Hubble Space Telescope to statistically constrain the distribution of dark matter halos, which is related to their fundamental properties.

I also have worked on other projects related to the graphical notation of vector calculus, physics-informed machine learning, and Korean science poems.

Thanks!
